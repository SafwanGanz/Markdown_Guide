## Headings

### Overview

Headings are a fundamental part of Markdown, allowing you to organize content into sections and subsections. They’re essential for creating structure, improving readability, and guiding readers through your document. In Markdown, headings are defined using the `#` symbol, with the number of `#`s indicating the heading level.

### Syntax

Markdown supports six levels of headings, from `H1` (the largest) to `H6` (the smallest). Here’s how to write them:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

#### Example Output
When rendered, these headings look like this (appearance depends on the Markdown renderer):

- `# Heading 1` → Largest, top-level heading  
- `## Heading 2` → Slightly smaller, often used for main sections  
- `### Heading 3` → Subsection size  
- And so on, down to `###### Heading 6` (smallest).

### Alternative Syntax

For `H1` and `H2`, Markdown also supports an alternative syntax using `=` and `-` lines beneath the text:

```markdown
Heading 1
=========

Heading 2
---------
```

This produces the same result as `# Heading 1` and `## Heading 2`.

### Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use heading levels logically (e.g., don’t jump from `H1` to `H4` without `H2` or `H3`).
- **Clarity**: Keep heading text short and descriptive.
- **Spacing**: Add a blank line before and after headings for better readability.

### Example in Context

Here’s how headings might structure a simple document:

```markdown
# My Document

## Introduction

This is the intro.

## Main Content

### Subsection A

### Subsection B
